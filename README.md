# LLM RL Environments Lil Course

![LLM RL Environments Lil Course](./images/course_image.png)

A little course on Reinforcement Learning Environments for evaluating and training Language Models.

Unlike classic fine-tuning, RL environments let models explore and improve beyond what curated datasets can teach.

In this course, we'll build a Tic Tac Toe environment and use it to transform a Small Language Model 
(`LiquidAI/LFM2-2.6B`) into a master player that beats `gpt-5-mini`.

## Who is this course for?
- **AI Engineers**: You are familiar with classic LLM fine-tuning techniques (Supervised Fine-Tuning) but have little to no experience with Reinforcement Learning.
- **Traditional RL Practitioners**: You know how RL works, but you want to learn how to apply it to Language Models.
- **Curious Tinkerers**: You keep hearing about "reasoning models" and RL post-training, and you want to see how it works under the hood.
